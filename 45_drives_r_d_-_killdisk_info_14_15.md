# Hard-Disk Drive Wipe Time


*  The Destroyinator runs on CentOS 7 which is pre-loaded with Kill-disk, a hard-drive wiping software package.

*  The Drive Wipe Time depends on the physical size of the HDD - Not the number of them, they are all wiped at the same time.

*  For example, if you have 44 1TB drives and 1 6TB Drive which you are attempting to wipe, your total time will be the time of the 6 TB drive.

### Drive Wipe Time Approximations


*  There are many wipe procedures in which you clear a disk. Essentially, each procedure writes 0's to every sector of the drive a certain number of times. 1 time up to 35 times. The number of "passes" depends on what wipe procedure you choose. 

*  The Rocket 750 and LSI 9201 wipe drives at the same rate - the LSI however can wipe SSDs and SAS drives.\\


*  For a One Pass Zeros of 1 TB Drives, it takes about 1.5 hours

*  For a One Pass Zeros of 3 TB Drives, it takes about 7.5 hours

*  For a One Pass Zeros of 6 TB Drives, it takes about 9 hours

*  For a US DoD 5220.22-M of 1 TB Drives, it takes about 3.5 hours

*  For a US DoD 5220.22-M of 3 TB Drives, it takes about 16 hours

*  For a US DoD 5220.22-M of 6 TB Drives, it takes about 20 hours

**Note: The 3 TB drive used was a desktop drive, which is a bit slower than enterprise drives.**
