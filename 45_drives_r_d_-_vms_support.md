NOTES:

**exacqVision**

-Exacqvision Trial https://www.exacq.com/trialkey/

-We know exactqvision works on the server no problem as per Johnny Hernandez @ PharmaCannis. It requires Ubuntu 14.04 which is no problem.

-Rob figured out how to get the software to recognise and use zfs pools.

-Multiple people have asked about it now. We have set up one solution already. (Pharma Cannis)

**DW Spectrum**

-DWS Trial http://digital-watchdog.com/DW_Spectrum/

-We know storinator works as storage target via SMB and DWS. This is what Aurora cannabis is doing. DWS has a linux server version so all in one package is possible.

-No first hand experience with DWS however.

-Very Negative experience with them at Surveillance trade show. 

**Axxon**

-Axxon Trial http://www.axxonsoft.com/products/axxon_next/specifications/

-No linux version of software, therefore all in one package could only be achieved with Virtualisation (Complicated).

-Storinator still viable option as storage target for Axxon VMS.

-Positive experience with them at Surveillance trade show.
