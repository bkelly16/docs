# 45 Drives - Erasure Coding

### EC Plugins


Multiple EC algorithms available. Default in ceph is jerasure, most perfromant seems to be ISA. ISA only works with Intel CPUs however.

See this [link](https///blog.dachary.org/2015/05/12/ceph-jerasure-and-isa-plugins-benchmarks/) on performance comparsions.

Good resource on how erasure coding in Ceph is implemented. https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2015/04/06/ceph-erasure-coding-introduction
