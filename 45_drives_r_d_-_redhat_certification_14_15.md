## Certification Prerequisites

**NOTE we cant use highpoint drivers during testing.. see prereq number 2


*  We certify hardware models and not specific configurations of a model. All optional hardware configurations designated as part of the same model must be tested.

*  Testing must be performed with a standard installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux without special configuration or additional software, including drivers not provided by Red Hat.

*  Certifications are currently available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7. Also, optionally for Red Hat Enterprise MRG Realtime 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Compute 3, 4, and 5, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtualization Hypervizor 7.

*  Certifications are awarded against a specific major.minor release and architecture (e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 for x86_64) and are not specific to variants (i.e. Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Platform, Desktop or Server).
