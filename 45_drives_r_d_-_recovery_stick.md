# Recovery Stick


When customers either wipe there booties and need to re-install or just want to switch OS'

Instead of a fresh install themselves, they can download a "Recovery Image" from us.

It contains two partitions, a CloneZilla Live boot and a larger partition for storage of the desired images.

When the image is placed on a USB drive plug into the MOBO slot and make sure you have teh boot drive(s) plugged in as well.

boot from the USB stick, tell Clonezilla to dump itself to RAM so it unmounts the boot partition and allows Clonezilla to access the images in the 2nd partition

Follow a documented process produced by us.

When complete they remove the USB stick and reboot into the OS of their choice.
