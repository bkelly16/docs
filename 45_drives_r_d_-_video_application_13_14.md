# 45 Drives R&D - Video Application 13 14

10 July 2014\\

## Why we should take notice.

\\
As technology advances, and prices decrease, video surveillance may possibly be a very profitable industry for 45 Drives.
With these advances in video surveillance technology, comes an increase need for more bandwidth and mass storage.  45 Drives offers a a product
to which these industries can take advantage of. Therefore we must have a good general understanding to answer future customer inquiries.
The Storinator 4.0 and future 45 drives products must to be spec'd to meet the needs required for high speed, high data storage
video application. 

Video bandwidth varies with different methods of encoding, resolutions, frequency's, color models, depth and screen action. 
After research (sources listed) these are the average megabits per second values for various resolutions and frames per second 
for the two most widely used video codecs.

On the right is the maximum amout of cameras that can be utlized on a 1 gigabit network.  

*Take note these are all average values, and can vary.*

## Storinator performace

\\
 | Rocket 750 Max Theoretical Throughput per drive in a PCI Express 2.0 8x slot||\\
 | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | 4000.00^MBytes/s Max Throughput                                                  | \\
 | 45.00	^# of Drives                                                               | \\
 | 88.89	^Per drive                                                                 | \\
 | 2.00	^2 Rocket 750s                                                              | \\
 | 177.78	^MBytes/s Per Drive Max Theoretical                                       | \\

With a theoretical limit of 1422.4 Megabits per second (177 Mega bytes)written to each drive;\\ the Storinator is more than well equipped to handle
large amounts of throughput that will be delivered.
