The Backblaze 4.5 POD has the following major hardware components:\\

**Motherboard:**\\
Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F (MicroATX)\\

**RAM:**\\
2x 2GB DDR3 RAM\\
240P PC3-10600 CL9 18C 256X8 DD - \\
Total RAM: 4GB\\

**HBA /SATA3 Card:**\\

## Initial Testing

Upon initial boot a 45 drive 1TB RAID 6 was synced inside the machine. This took about 14 hours to complete. There were no issues.\\
The machine was left running idle for 24 hours with the RAID 6 fully synced. - No issues\\
Next, 9 5-drive 1TB RAID6 were synced inside the machine. - This was done to simulate a large amount of communication between the SATA 3 cards and the Port Multiplier Backplanes - again there was no issues wth this.\\

## Benchmarking

The Backblaze POD 4.5 was bench-marked against the 45Drives Storinator s45lite, s45 and s45 w/ LSI Cards, detailed results can be found in this living document:
