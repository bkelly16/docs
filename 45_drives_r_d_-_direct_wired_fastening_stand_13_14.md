## Backplane Jig Testing

9 July 2014\\

Testing was completed to determine how effective the stand was in reducing production time.\\
Overall, to complete a set of backplanes, (3 backplanes) took on average 45-60 minutes without utilizing the stand.\\
With the stand in place, production time was reduced to 30-45 minutes.\\
Combined with an automatic screw gun, it's certain backplane production time will again see another significant future decrease.\\
